Hi, I'm Davide, a developer focused on frontend technologies.

Since 2009 I spent so many hours on developing interfaces for small and big closed-source projects.

I come from a family of designers <a href="https://vago.studio/en" target="_blank">Check out our family's art gallery</a>.
During my early life I developed a keen eye on design and user experience (which is not just digital), permitting later on to produce qualitative UI/web design projects/products.

I'm currently working as Lead UI developer at Cognitive Credit, a fintech startup based in London (UK) which focuses in the financial credit market. 
At Cognitive Credit, I'm responsible of the product design and frontend development, the company's brand identity and collaterals.

I never contributed on open-source projects but happy to start helping out if requested. :genie_man:

I'm also available for small/mid side projects or tasks that can be achieved in the spare time (weekends/evenings).

Feel free to contact me on Twitter :email:

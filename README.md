Hi, I'm Davide, I'm a developer focused on frontend technologies.

Since 2009 I spent so many hours on developing interfaces for small and big closed-source projects.

I come from a family of designers so since I was young I developed a keen eye on design and user experience, permitting me to produce qualitative UI/web design.

I'm currently working as Lead UI developer at Cognitive Credit, a fintech startup based in London (UK) which focuses in the financial credit market, where I'm responsible of the product design and frontend development, the company's brand identity and the collaterals.

I never contributed on open-source projects but happy to start helping out if requested. :genie_man:

I'm also available for small/mid side projects or tasks that can be achieved in the spare time (weekends/evenings).

Feel free to contact me on Twitter :email:

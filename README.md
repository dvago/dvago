Hi, I'm Davide, a developer focused on front-end technologies.

Since 2009 I have spent many hours developing interfaces for small and big closed-source projects.

I come from a family of designers <a href="https://vago.studio/en" target="_blank">Check out our family's art gallery</a>.

During my early life, I developed a keen eye for design and user experience (which is not just digital), permitting later on to produce qualitative UI/web design projects/products.

Between 2019 and 2022, I built the web product and brand identity for Cognitive Credit, a London (UK) based fintech startup focused on the financial credit market. From my initial inception, the startup grew up, securing several funding rounds and becoming one of the most "need-to-have" services for the top worldwide financial institutions.

In late 2022 I joined Maekersuite as technical lead / "CTO", an early-stage startup with the mission to improve the quality and professionalism of storytelling. 

I never contributed to open-source projects but happy to start helping out if requested. :genie_man:

I'm also available for small/mid-side projects, technical consultations or just hands-on tasks that can be achieved in my spare time (weekends/evenings).

Feel free to contact me on Twitter or via Linkedin InMail :email:
